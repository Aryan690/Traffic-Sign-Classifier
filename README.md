# Traffic-Sign-Classifier
Built a system that is used in Self-Driving cars for detection and classification of Traffic Signs.

Created a system with a famous Deep Network known as LeNet to classify Traffic Signs. Using camera data Self-Driving cars need to detect objects and classify to know when to stop, yields and how fast it will drive.

Trained LeNet to classify traffic signs to the Real World Datasets, optimized network architectures to improve the classification performance, evaluate the model and presented results using Confusion Matrices and Classification Reports.
